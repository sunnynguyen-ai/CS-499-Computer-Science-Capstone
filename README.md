# SNHU CS-499: Computer Science Capstone

**by Sunny Nguyen**

Welcome to my Computer Science Capstone portfolio for Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU).

This repository contains all major components of my final capstone project, including:

- A complete **code review**
- Three **enhancements** demonstrating growth in:
  - Software Engineering & Design
  - Algorithms & Data Structures
  - Databases & Security
- A **professional self-assessment**
- A deployed **GitHub Pages ePortfolio** that showcases my work

This portfolio represents the culmination of my Computer Science degree and highlights my ability to apply advanced software engineering practices, optimize algorithms and data structures, design secure systems, and deliver maintainable, scalable solutions.
