# **Sunny Nguyen — Computer Science Capstone Portfolio**
Welcome to my CS-499 Capstone ePortfolio for Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU).  
This site showcases the work I completed for my final Computer Science capstone, including a formal code review, three major enhancements, and a professional self-assessment.

The purpose of this portfolio is to demonstrate my mastery of computer science principles, software engineering practices, and my growth into a professional developer capable of producing secure, scalable, and maintainable solutions.
