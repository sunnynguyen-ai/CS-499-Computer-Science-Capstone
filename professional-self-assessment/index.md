# Professional Self-Assessment

**Sunny Nguyen — CS-499 Computer Science Capstone**

## Introduction

Throughout my time in the Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU), I have gained technical knowledge, professional skills, and real-world development experience that prepared me to succeed as a software engineer.

This self-assessment highlights how the program helped me grow in key areas such as **software engineering, algorithms and data structures, databases, security, communication, and collaborative problem-solving**.

My capstone project demonstrates this development by enhancing a real Android application, improving its architecture, algorithms, and security — reflecting my readiness for professional practice.

## Software Engineering and Design

One of the most valuable areas of growth in the program has been in applying professional software engineering principles. Earlier in my studies, my work was mostly functional but not always maintainable or scalable. Through courses in object-oriented design, software testing, and full-stack development, I learned to:

- Use modular and reusable code
- Apply clean-code and SOLID principles
- Separate UI logic from business logic
- Implement well-structured classes and methods
- Document code and write maintainable solutions

In my capstone Enhancement One, I applied these principles to improve the Android application's structure. This experience showed me how good engineering practices directly improve a project's long-term success.

## Algorithms and Data Structures

Before entering the program, my understanding of algorithmic efficiency was limited to basic concepts. Through courses in data structures, operating systems, and algorithm analysis, I learned how to:

- Evaluate time and space complexity
- Use appropriate data structures for performance
- Optimize database queries
- Reduce redundant work
- Apply algorithmic reasoning to real systems

In Enhancement Two, I used these skills to optimize SQLite performance by adding B-tree indexes and caching cursor indices. These improvements transformed O(n) table scans into O(log n) indexed lookups. This enhancement demonstrated my ability to apply algorithms to improve real-world applications.

## Databases and Security

Security has become a critical part of my skill set. SNHU's coursework in secure coding, database design, and backend development taught me to:

- Validate input and sanitize data
- Use parameterized queries
- Protect sensitive information
- Understand authentication principles
- Identify common vulnerabilities

In Enhancement Three, I strengthened the Android app's input validation, improved authentication logic, and ensured safer handling of user data. This experience reinforced the importance of security in every stage of software development.

## Collaboration and Communication

Although the capstone is an individual project, collaboration and communication were core skills developed throughout the program. Courses requiring team projects taught me to:

- Communicate technical ideas clearly
- Write professional documentation
- Use Git and version control for teamwork
- Break down large tasks into smaller deliverables
- Provide and receive constructive technical feedback

These skills prepared me to present my code review and clearly articulate the reasoning behind each enhancement in the capstone.

## Full-Stack and Mobile Development

I gained practical experience across multiple platforms:

- Android (Java)
- Web development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
- Backend systems (Python, Java, SQL)
- Database storage (SQLite, MySQL)
- Cloud and version control (GitHub)

This broad skill set allowed me to approach the capstone with flexibility and confidence.

---

## Readiness for Professional Practice

My completed capstone project demonstrates that I can:

- Analyze existing systems and identify weaknesses
- Improve software design, structure, and maintainability
- Apply algorithms to optimize performance
- Strengthen database and authentication security
- Communicate technical decisions professionally
- Deliver a complete, well-documented software solution

These abilities reflect the expectations of real industry roles, such as software engineer, mobile developer, full-stack engineer, or backend developer.

## Conclusion

The Computer Science program at SNHU has prepared me to enter the field with confidence. Through hands-on development, algorithmic problem-solving, secure coding practices, and professional documentation, I have grown into a capable and thoughtful software engineer.

My capstone portfolio represents the culmination of these skills and showcases my readiness for professional work in modern software development environments.
