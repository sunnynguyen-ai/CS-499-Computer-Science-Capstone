# Enhancement One — Software Engineering & Design

## Overview

Enhancement One focuses on improving the software engineering and design quality of the selected Android application originally created earlier in the SNHU Computer Science program. The goal of this enhancement is to strengthen the architecture, maintainability, readability, and professional quality of the codebase while applying modern software engineering practices.

For this enhancement, I worked specifically on improving **structural design**, **separation of concerns**, **reusability**, and **overall code maintainability** across the application. These improvements make the project more scalable, easier to extend, and better aligned with real-world industry expectations.

## 1. Description of the Original Artifact

The original artifact was an Android application developed during earlier coursework (CS-360). The structure of the code was functional, but it suffered from several common design limitations:

- Logic and UI concerns were mixed in the same activities
- Hard-coded values reduced flexibility
- Duplicate code existed across multiple classes
- Some classes were too large, violating clean-architecture principles
- Input validation was minimal
- There was no layering or clear separation of responsibilities

Although the application ran correctly, its structure was not ideal for long-term maintenance or scalability.

## 2. Enhancement Summary

The goal of this enhancement was to improve software engineering practices using:

- Clean code principles
- Separation of concerns (SoC)
- Modularization and reusability
- Better class responsibilities
- Improved UI input validation
- More consistent naming and formatting
- Code refactoring to reduce duplication

Professional-grade improvements were applied to strengthen the application's structure and prepare it for the enhancements in Milestones 3-2 and 4-2.

## 3. Course Outcomes Addressed

This enhancement directly supports the following CS-499 Course Outcome:

### Course Outcome 1 – Employ strategies for building collaborative environments

- Applying clean design principles supports teamwork and system scalability
- Improved modularization allows other developers to integrate features more easily
- Cleaner architecture reduces the cognitive load for future contributors

It also supports course outcomes related to **software engineering**, **design**, **testing**, and **professional communication**, since the artifact now reflects industry-standard structure and documentation practices.

## 4. Reflection on the Enhancement Process

While completing this enhancement, I strengthened my understanding of how software engineering decisions impact long-term maintainability. Refactoring required careful analysis to ensure that changes did not introduce regressions. I also had to revisit earlier logic to identify duplicated code, unnecessary complexity, and unclear responsibilities within classes.

I learned the importance of:

- Keeping UI logic separate from data logic
- Creating reusable helper methods
- Designing activities that are easier to extend
- Structuring a project so future developers can navigate it quickly

These refinements improved both the design and professionalism of the codebase, preparing the project for the performance and security enhancements implemented later in the capstone.
